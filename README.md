# üìö‚ú® Library Management System

üõ†Ô∏è A handmade C++ library ecosystem with file-based logic, no SQL, and full pointer control.

A fully-featured, file-based üìÅ library + user ecosystem built entirely in **C++**.  
‚ùå No SQL. No database. Just pure logic, classes, and smart file manipulation with `.txt` files.  
Built with üíª, üí° and a lot of üí™ in just **1 month** ‚Äî completed in **1 single day**.

---

## üî• Core Features

### üë• Account System
- üßë‚Äçüíº Create & login as **User** or **Library Owner**
- üîê Password-protected access
- üö´ Duplicate check (no reused names, phones, or emails)
- üì¶ Data saved in `user.txt` and `library.txt`

### üè¢ Library Owner Panel
- ‚ûï Add books (with ID, date, category, price, etc.)
- ‚ùå Delete books (safely archived)
- üí∞ Update book prices
- üóëÔ∏è View deleted books
- üìÑ Each library stored in its own `.txt` (e.g. `mylibrary.txt`)

### üë§ User Panel
- üìö Browse available libraries
- üí∏ Buy books (removed from library file, saved in your `_bought.txt`)
- üì• Rent books (added to your `_rent.txt`, not removed)
- üìú View buy & rent history in detail

### üß† File-Based Storage (no DB!)
- üìÑ Uses only `.txt` files to persist all data
- üßÆ Dynamically calculates book count based on file contents
- üßπ Book entries use a clear separator: `/-/`

### ‚≠ê Exit Rating System
- üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Ask for feedback when quitting the app
- üìà Users and libraries can rate the app (0‚Äì10)
- üíæ Ratings stored in `rate.txt`

---

## üí° Notes

- ‚úÖ Project contains **45+ files** including `.cpp` & `.hpp`
- üîÅ Data fully preserved between sessions using file I/O
- ‚è±Ô∏è Created from scratch in **~12 hours** of focused coding
- üéì Final project for university ‚Äî built with professional care

---

## üíª Tech Stack

- üöÄ **C++** (OOP, Pointers, File Streams, Menus)
- üß™ Compiled with g++ / CLion
- üìü 100% terminal interface
- üîÅ No third-party libraries

---

## üß† Advanced Concepts & Code Practices

- üîó All data is dynamically allocated on the **heap** using raw pointers  
- üß† Maximum usage of `new` / `delete` and deep manual memory management  
- üö´ No use of helper tools like `struct`, `vector`, `array`, or `smart pointers`  
- üßº Code was repeatedly tested ‚Äî **no discovered memory leaks**  
- üõ† Designed with a deep focus on logic, control flow, and data isolation  
- üßÉ Pure, pointer-based simulation ‚Äî zero shortcuts

---

## ü§ù AI Support (1%)

This project was hand-coded from scratch with ~99% manual effort.  
Around 1% of guidance, idea validation, and logic debugging was assisted by AI.

> No AI-generated code was directly copied ‚Äî all logic was self-implemented.

---

## üå± Future Plans (Summer or Autumn 2025)

- üñ•Ô∏è A full **GUI version** of this system is planned using **Qt Framework**
- üé® All current logic will be preserved and upgraded with a modern interface
- üîß Project will be modularized and ported for better UI/UX experience
- üß© Potential multi-language support: **Polish üáµüá±**, **Russian üá∑üá∫**, **Turkish üáπüá∑**
